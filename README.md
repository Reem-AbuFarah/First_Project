# Predicting the prices of diamonds in the 'diamonds' Dataset

Below you can find a pdf showing a summary of our work on the 'diamonds' Dataset, as well as the interactive python notebook showing our code.The task was to create a machine learning system that could predict the prices of diamonds, but we used a logarithmic transformation to overcome obstacles such as outliers and the skewed distribution of some of our features.Howerer this method proved to be ultimately useless as its effect on the RMSE relative to the range the target variable of our machine learning algorithms was barely noticable when compared to using the algorithms without transforming the variables.
